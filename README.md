# bizhawk-communication
Repo for examples of how to talk to a running BizHawk instance. Check each folder for different implementations and further information about them.

To run these examples, you will need to also have an instance of Bizhawk installed. Some of the example may require that you have NodeJS installed, to run the program that communicates with Bizhawk.
